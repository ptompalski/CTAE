# CTAE
A collection of tools to calculate tree- or stand-level attributes developed for Canadian forests


## Models included so far

- Canadian national tree aboveground biomass equations (Lambert et al. 2005, Ung et al. 2008).

- Individual tree volume equations for major Alberta tree species (Huang 1994)

- Volume-to-biomass conversions models (Boudewyn et al. 2007)

- Total volume to merchantable volume conversions models (Boudewyn et al. 2007)


Updated model parameters for models developed by Boudewyn et al (2007) downloaded from https://nfi.nfis.org/en/biomass_models.
