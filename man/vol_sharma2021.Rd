\title{Sharma (2021) stem volume using DBH and total height}
\usage{
vol_sharma2021(DBH, height, species)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBH}{Tree diameter at breast height (cm)}

\item{height}{Total height (m)}

\item{species}{Species code (e.g., "PICE.MAR")}
}
\value{
tibble with columns \code{vol_total} and \code{vol_merchantable} (m3)
}
\description{
Estimates total (inside-bark) and merchantable (inside-bark) stem volume
using the Sharma (2021) dimensionally compatible model developed for
commercial tree species in central/eastern Canada and the northeastern US.
}
\details{
Merchantable volume parameters correspond to Sharma's fixed merchantability
definition (0.3 m stump, 7 cm inside-bark top diameter), and are not
user-configurable.
}
\examples{
# Single tree
vol_sharma2021(
  DBH = 30,
  height = 22,
  species = "PICE.MAR"
)

# Multiple trees, mixed species
vol_sharma2021(
  DBH = c(25, 32, 18),
  height = c(20, 24, 15),
  species = c("PICE.GLA", "ABIE.BAL", "PINU.BAN")
)

# Works with the pipe operator:
trees <- tibble::tibble(
  tree_id = 1:4,
  dbh = c(22, 30, 18, 35),
  ht  = c(18, 24, 15, 27),
  species = c("PICE.GLA", "PICE.GLA", "ABIE.BAL", "PINU.BAN")
