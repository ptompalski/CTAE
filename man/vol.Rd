\title{Calculate tree volume: choose best available model or run all candidate models}
\usage{
vol(
  DBH,
  height = NA_real_,
  species,
  jurisdiction,
  subregion = NA_character_,
  pick_best = TRUE,
  keep_model_id = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBH}{Numeric vector. Diameter at breast height (cm).}

\item{height}{Numeric vector. Total height (m). Can be `NA` to use the DBH-only models (currently only `vol_ung2013()`).}

\item{species}{Character vector. Species codes (e.g., "PICE.GLA").}

\item{jurisdiction}{Character scalar or vector. Province/territory code (e.g., "BC", "QC").}

\item{subregion}{Optional character vector. Subregion identifier (e.g., BEC zone for `vol_kozak94()`).}

\item{pick_best}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), pick the single best model per tree using `rank`.
If `FALSE`, compute all candidate model outputs per tree and return a list-column
(one tibble per tree) that can be unnested for comparison.}

\item{keep_model_id}{Logical. If `TRUE`, include a `vol_model` column with the engine function name used.}
}
\value{
If `pick_best = TRUE`, a tibble with one row per tree and columns:
`vol_total`, `vol_merchantable`, and optionally `vol_model`.

If `pick_best = FALSE`, a list (suitable for use as a list-column in `dplyr::mutate()`)
with one element per tree. Each element is a tibble of candidate model outputs
(`vol_total`, `vol_merchantable`, and optionally `vol_model`).
}
\description{
`vol()` is the main convenience wrapper for estimating total and
merchantable stem volume from diameter and height. It automatically
selects and runs one (or more) of the volume models implemented in CanadaForestAllometry,
based on the model registry returned by [volume_model_registry()].
}
\section{Model selection logic}{

Model selection is driven by the model registry and occurs per input tree:
\enumerate{
  \item Geographic applicability: models are filtered to those whose
    `province_scope` includes the provided `jurisdiction` (or `"ALL"`).
  \item Species coverage: models are filtered to those that include the
    provided `species` in their parameter tables. Some models may include
    genus/group codes (e.g., `"PICE.SPP"`); these are treated
    as covering all matching species within that genus/group.
  \item Required inputs: models that require total height are excluded
    when `height` is missing. Models that require a subregion (e.g., BEC zone
    for certain provincial models) are excluded when `subregion` is missing.
  \item Model ranking: if multiple eligible models remain, `pick_best = TRUE`
    selects the highest-ranked model (`rank`) for each tree.
}
}

\section{Fallback behavior}{

Availability is evaluated at the species level, not only by jurisdiction.
This means a regional/provincial model may exist for a jurisdiction but may
not include coefficients for the provided species. In such cases, `vol()`
automatically falls back to another eligible model (e.g., a multi-province
regional model or a national model) that *does* cover the species and required
inputs.
}

\section{Important limitations and recommended use}{

\itemize{
  \item This is an automatic wrapper. Because selection is registry-driven,
    `vol()` may use a model that is not the one you intended (e.g., a national
    model instead of a regional model, or a different regional model than you
    expected), especially when the preferred model is not available for the
    input species or missing required inputs.
  \item Model outputs differ. Different models will generally return
    slightly different volume estimates for the same DBH/height/species due to
    differences in model form, fitted data, geographic scope, and
    merchantability assumptions. These differences are expected.
  \item If you require a specific model, do not use `vol()`. Instead, call
    the relevant model function directly (e.g., `vol_huang94()`, `vol_kozak94()`,
    `vol_ung2013()`, etc.) to ensure full control and reproducibility.
  \item Investigate before operational use. It is strongly recommended to
    run `vol()` with `pick_best = FALSE` during exploratory analyses to inspect
    which models are eligible and how sensitive results are to model choice.
    When `pick_best = FALSE`, `vol()` returns a list-column (one element per
    tree) containing a tibble of candidate model outputs; this can be unnested
    to compare models.

\examples{
## --- Basic usage: pick best available model (default) ---
vol(
  DBH = 20,
  height = 20,
  species = "PICE.MAR",
  jurisdiction = "ON"
)

## --- Return all applicable models (one row per engine) ---
## Note: national Ung DBH-only and DBH+HT variants are collapsed
## into a single result (preferring the height-based variant).
vol(
  DBH = 20,
  height = 20,
  species = "PICE.MAR",
  jurisdiction = "ON",
  pick_best = FALSE,
  keep_model_id = TRUE
)

## --- Missing height: height-dependent models are skipped ---
## Falls back to DBH-only models where available (e.g. national Ung).
vol(
  DBH = 25,
  species = "BETU.PAP",
  jurisdiction = "QC"
)

## --- Regional model with required subregion (BC example) ---
## Kozak (1994) requires a BEC zone; if provided, it is preferred.
vol(
  DBH = 30,
  height = 22,
  species = "THUJ.PLI",
  jurisdiction = "BC",
  subregion = "CWH"
)

## --- Automatic fallback when a regional model does not cover species ---
## If no provincial model covers the species, a suitable national or
## multi-province regional model is used instead.
vol(
  DBH = 18,
  height = 15,
  species = "ACER.SAC",
  jurisdiction = "MB"

## --- Vectorized input ---

  DBH = c(18, 25, 32),
  height = c(15, 20, 25),

  keep_model_id = TRUE
