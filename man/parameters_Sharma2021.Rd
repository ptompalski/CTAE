\title{Sharma (2021) tree volume model parameters}
\format{
A tibble with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{Species}{NFI species code}
  \item{volume_type}{Included are paramaters for the merchantable inside bark, total inside bark, and total outside bark volume}
  \item{alpha}{Intercept parameter}
  \item{beta}{Scale parameter}
  \item{gamma}{Exponent for DBH (height exponent is \eqn{3 - \gamma})}
}

\description{
Species-specific parameters for the dimensionally compatible tree volume
equations developed by Sharma (2021) for major commercial tree species
in central and eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.
}
\details{
The model has the following form:
\deqn{
V = \alpha + \beta D^{\gamma} H^{3-\gamma}
}
where \eqn{V} is tree volume (m\eqn{^3}),
\eqn{D} is diameter at breast height (DBH, m),
and \eqn{H} is total tree height (m).

Separate parameter sets are provided for:
\itemize{
  \item total volume, inside bark
  \item total volume, outside bark
  \item merchantable volume (inside bark)
}

Merchantable volume parameters correspond to a fixed merchantability
definition used by Sharma (2021): stump height of 0.3 m and a 7 cm
inside-bark top diameter.

\strong{Cedar species note:}
Sharma (2021) reports parameters for a pooled group labelled
\emph{"Cedar spp."}, derived from the Stem Data Management System (SDMS).
Because this group is not taxonomically explicit, the pooled cedar
parameters were reassigned in this dataset to
\code{JUNI.VIR} (eastern red cedar), which occurs in central and eastern
Canada. The parameters were not refitted; this reassignment represents
a direct substitution from the pooled cedar group and should be interpreted
accordingly.
