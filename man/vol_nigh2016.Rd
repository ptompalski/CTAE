\usage{
vol_nigh2016(DBH, height, species, subregion)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBH}{Numeric vector of diameter at breast height (cm).}

\item{height}{Numeric vector of total tree height (m).}

\item{species}{Character vector of species codes}

\item{subregion}{Character scalar or vector defining the spatial stratum for
the coefficients. Can be \code{"Coast"} / \code{"Interior"} or a BEC zone code
(e.g., \code{"CWH"}, \code{"ICH"}, \code{"BWBS"}). Must have length 1 or the
same length as \code{DBH}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with volumes (m\eqn{^3}):
\describe{
  \item{vol_total}{Numeric. Total stem volume (m\eqn{^3}), under bark.}
  \item{vol_merchantable}{Numeric. Merchantable stem volume (m\eqn{^3}), under bark.}
}
}
\description{
Implementation of the British Columbia volume equations developed by Nigh (2016).
The model calculates total stem volume and merchantable stem volume as a function of diameter at
breast height (DBH) and total tree height.
}
\details{
Parameters are stratified either by region (\code{"Coast"}, \code{"Interior"})
or by BEC zone (e.g., \code{"CWH"}, \code{"ICH"}, \code{"BWBS"}), depending on
which parameter row is requested via \code{subregion}.

Model form (Nigh 2016):
\deqn{V = \exp(b_0) \cdot DBH^{b_1} \cdot H^{b_2}}
where \eqn{V} is volume (m\eqn{^3}), \eqn{DBH} is in cm, and \eqn{H} is in m.

Merchantable volume in Nigh (2016) is defined as total volume minus stump
(0.3 m) and top volume above a 4 cm inside-bark diameter threshold (fixed
definition in the original report).
